# Car Park Challenge


Create a class called Cars for a car parking company.
This will allow you to store information of: 
car registration number, number of hours parked and total amount charged. (Say Â£1.50 per hour?)
The first car entered the car park, parked for 5 hours and ready to pay. 
Display this information so the driver can pay for his/her parking fee.
